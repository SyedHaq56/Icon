      <p style="border:15px; border-style:solid; border-color:black; padding: 2em;">Bikers and pedestrians injured in traffic collisions stood alongside family members of others who died in similar accidents, demanding the city create more protected
        bike lanes in The Bronx on Sept. 16. Transportation Alternatives joined
        Families For Safe
        Streets in organizing the vigil. "We stand with our same heavy eyes and we have the same moments of silence, and we hear the same words," said Danny Harris, 41, Executive Director of Transportation Alternatives, addressing the victims. "We
        have
        to go to vigil after vigil to simply get our mayor to take the action that he had committed to, by advancing Vision Zero."</p>
